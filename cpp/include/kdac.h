// Please refer to the paper published in PAMI by Liu, Dy and Jordan at:
// http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/papers/niu-dy-jordan-pami.pdf
// We try to follow naming conventions in the paper as much as possible.
// The lower cased variable names is the same as in the paper, and the
// upper cased matrix variable names in the paper are converted to lower
// case suffixed with "_matrix". For example:
// matrix U in the paper is named u_matrix in this implementation.
